				"In addition, on a failed saving throw the ghostly hands grapple the target until the end of your next turn, and immediately move the target up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice (but not upward). On its turn, the creature can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple by making a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, the grapple ends."
