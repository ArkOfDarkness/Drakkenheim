				"Choose a creature you can see within range that doesn't have all its hit points. You infect the target's wounds with putrefying bacteria. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it has less than half its maximum hit points remaining, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 10d8} necrotic damage and gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not gain any {@condition exhaustion} levels."
