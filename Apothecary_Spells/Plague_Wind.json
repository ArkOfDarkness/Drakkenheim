				"You summon a roiling wind of flesh devouring disease and excruciating blood boiling fumes that sweeps over the area emanating from you in a 120-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw a creature takes {@damage 5d8} poison damage and {@damage 5d8} necrotic damage or half as much damage on a success. After taking this damage, any affected creature with 25 hit points or fewer remaining immediately dies and is reduced to a weathered skeleton as their flesh and soft tissue blows off like ash."
