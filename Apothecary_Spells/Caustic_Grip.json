				"For the spell's duration, your hand secretes sticky burning acid which you can use to hold a creature in a painful clutch. When you cast this spell, and as an action on your turn until the spell ends, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, you deal {@damage 4d4} acid damage to the target, and the creature is {@condition restrained} in your acid grip until the end of your next turn. You can attack the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.",
				"A creature {@condition restrained} by your grip can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer {@condition restrained}. Each time a creature ends its turn {@condition restrained} by this spell, it takes an additional {@damage 4d4} acid damage."
